This was recovered from the jar because I lost the original source code. I remember the original had chinese letters in it. This is good for exploiting proot access on minecraft hosts like shockbyte and stealing their multicraft license key lol

Before you upload the jar, open the jar with 7zip and edit the port in application.properties to a random number

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
